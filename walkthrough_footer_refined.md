# Walkthrough - Final Footer Refinements

## Key Updates
- **Minimized Branding**: The logo is now 80px wide, and the tagline has been removed for a cleaner look.
- **Horizontal Navigation**: Links are now arranged in a single horizontal row at the top of the footer with reduced font size (0.85rem).
- **Subtle Animation**: The circular animated text ("MADE BY STARSHAPE .IN") has been scaled down (60px container, 8px font) to be more discreet.
- **Cornered Layout**: Copyright info and social links are pushed further into the corners for better space utilization.
