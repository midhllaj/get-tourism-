# Walkthrough - Git Force Push

I have completed the request to force push the current committed state to the remote repository.

## Changes Made
- Executed `git push origin main --force`.
- Remote repository [https://github.com/midhllaj/get-tourism-](https://github.com/midhllaj/get-tourism-) is now synchronized with the local `main` branch.

## Verification Results
- **Git Push Command**: Returned `Everything up-to-date`, confirming that the remote `main` branch already matched the local committed state.
- **Git Remote Check**: Verified that the local `main` branch is configured to track and is in sync with `origin/main`.

> [!NOTE]
> As requested, untracked files (such as local walkthroughs and task files) were **not** included in this push. They remain as untracked files in your local workspace.
