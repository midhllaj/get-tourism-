# Walkthrough - Footer Layout Refinement

## Changes Made
- **Logo Integration**: Replaced the text "Great Escapes Tourism" in the footer with the company logo (`/assets/get logo.png`).
- **Layout Alignment**:
    - Removed "Explore" and "Company" headers from the navigation links to allow content to align to the top.
    - Updated `styles.css` to ensure the `.footer-top` container uses `align-items: flex-start`.
- **Styling**:
    - Added CSS for `.footer-logo` to ensure proper sizing (max-width: 180px) and visibility.

## How to Verify
1. Scroll to the footer of any page.
2. Verify that the company logo is visible on the left side.
3. Verify that the navigation links on the right are aligned to the top and no longer have headers.
