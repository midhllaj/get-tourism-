# Walkthrough - Circular Text Animation

## Changes
- Created `src/components/CircularText.css`: Styles for the circular animation and container.
- Created `src/components/CircularText.js`: Vanilla JS component that generates the rotating text.
- Updated `src/components/Footer.js`: Integrated `CircularText` into the footer, replacing the static text.

## Verification
1. Open the application in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
2. Scroll down to the footer.
3. You should see "MADE BY STARSHAPE .IN" arranged in a small circle, spinning slowly.
4. **Hover** over the text to see it speed up.
5. **Mouse leave** to return to normal speed.
