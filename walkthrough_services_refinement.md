# Walkthrough - Refined Services Section Layout

The services section on the home page has been refined for better spacing and visibility of key elements.

## Changes Made
- **Background Match**: The services section now uses the same light grey radial dot background as the "Featured Trips" section.
- **Heading Fine-tuning**: 
    - Moved the "Our Services" text further down from the top of the section.
    - Reduced the gap between the heading and the service cards to move them closer together.
    - **Color Match**: Set the heading color to `#02184C` to perfectly match the "Featured Trips" section.
- **MORE Button Visibility**: Centered the "MORE" button and ensured it's visible below the cards.

## Visual Verification
- Scroll to the "Our Services" section on the home page.
- Observe that "Our Services" title is now closer to the top of the cards.
- Observe that the "MORE" button is clearly visible and centered below the three service cards.
