# Walkthrough - Website Refinements & Enhancements

All recent changes have been saved and implemented. Below is a summary of the major improvements made to the Home and Contact pages.

## 1. Services Section Redesign (Home Page)
The "Our Services" section has been completely overhauled for a modern, seamless look:
- **Three-Column Layout**: Full-width columns for "Visit Visa", "Tour Packages", and "Flight Tickets".
- **Background Matching**: Applied the light grey radial dot pattern to match the "Featured Trips" section perfectly.
- **Heading Fine-tuning**: The heading color is now the corporate dark blue (`#02184C`), pushed further down from the top but closer to the cards for better visual flow.
- **Improved Spacing**: Vertical padding set to 120px for a more spacious, premium feel.

## 2. Layout & Spacing Adjustments
- **Section Transitions**: Removed the top margin from the "Why Choose Us" section to ensure a smooth transition from the services section.
- **Element Alignment**: Ensured the "MORE" button is centered and properly spaced.

## 3. Contact Page Enhancements
The Contact page now features advanced interactive elements:
- **Magic UI Ripple Background**: A dynamic, pulsating ripple effect integrated behind the content.
- **Visual Polish**: Background changed to light grey with updated dark blue text and icons to ensure the ripple effect is visible and professional.
- **Dynamic Booking Boxes**: 
    - The contact form now automatically adds specific "booking detail boxes" based on the selected service.
    - Specially styled with their own backgrounds and borders to categorize information clearly.
